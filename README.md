Based on the paper [Towards the Formalisation of the TOGAF Content Metamodel using Ontologies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220708864_Towards_the_Formalisation_of_the_TOGAF_Content_Metamodel_using_Ontologies) by Aurona Gerber, Paula Kotze and Alta van der Merwe which is using [TOGAF 9 Content Metamodel](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap30.html).

A regulatory impact analysis solution based on the ontology was presented at the [Semantic Web London](https://www.meetup.com/semantic-web-london/) meetup. Source code is available on https://github.com/cadmiumkitty/ontologies-for-enterprise-architecture and the slides are https://www.slideshare.net/EugeneMorozov/documenting-enterprise-architectures-using-ontologies.

## Immediate Next Steps

 1. Address [issues](https://github.com/cadmiumkitty/togaf-content-metamodel-ontology/issues) of the original ontology

 1. Add or switch to Turtle serialization
 1. Clean up versioning 
 1. Put the ontology through the release process (logical consistency checks, RDFUnit, etc.)
 1. Add [Semantic MediaWiki](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki) mapping
 1. Find future home with a working group and regular releases behind the ontology to increase adoption
